**PROJECT SCENARIO**
<p align = 'justify'> Cake and Cookies Enterprise (CAKE) has hired your company to provide a conceptual design for a cake decorating shop. The shop will be fully automated with at least one cake decorating robot and one customer service robot. The general public is expected to interact with the customer service robot. You may assume undecorated cakes are delivered to the shop in preparation for decoration - i.e. baking is not within the scope. Otherwise, the scale of the shop is up to you. Your team is required to provide a design report and presentation of the conceptual design for the cake decorating shop, as well as demonstrate the feasibility of key features of the cake decorating robot using the IRB-120. </p>
